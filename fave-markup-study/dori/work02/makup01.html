                    <h3>Tagging 1 Million Product SKUs in 1 Day with 1 Employee</h3>
                    <p>After combining seven e-commerce platforms into one, LotteOn was looking for an automated product tagging solution to organize their expansive fashion inventory of 1M products. With $6B in annual revenue, LotteOn needed an intuitive solution that featured detailed fashion categories and attributes to establish nuanced product filters and an efficient product search engine. To optimize their website, LotteOn implemented OMNIOUS TAGGER.</p>

                    <h3>Creating a Positive Customer Experience in the Competitive U.S. Retail Fashion Market</h3>
                    <p>Rapidly growing shopping app, ABLY, was unable to create a positive customer experience due to a reliance on manual product tagging and limited search filters. Shoppers had a difficult time locating specific products, resulting in significant barriers to purchasing. To curb these issues, ABLY partnered with visual AI solutions developer, OMNIOUS.AI, to implement a hyper-personalized recommendation and product management system. After implementing OMNIOUS.AI, ABLY was able to automate internal processes and create a highly-rated shopping experience.</p>

                    <p>While the largest department store in Seoul, The Hyundai, was launching their e-commerce platform, the company struggled with error-ridden, manual SKU data processes. The Hyundai’s new website also featured inaccurate product recommendations and attribute information. To encourage in-store shoppers to expand their customer journey online and effectively compete with the online-native shopping destinations, The Hyundai wanted to implement an AI-based e-commerce solution that accurately presented and recommended products for prospective buyers.</p>
